# To-Do-Web-App
A user-friendly and intuitive to-do web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to help you stay organized by efficiently managing both completed and non-completed tasks.
The application prominently displays a list of your tasks, neatly dividing them into two sections: "Completed" and "Pending."
Your new task will immediately appear in the "Pending" section, ready for you to start working on it. Each task is accompanied by a marker, allowing you to mark it as complete when you've finished and when you complete a task, you can move it to the "Completed" section.
